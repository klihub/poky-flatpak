Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-sato
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

If you enable flatpak applications (by default they are enabled, see the
comments in local.conf), you get two additional sample images you can build:
    core-image-flatpak-runtime    flatpak-enabled version of core-image-minimal
    core-image-flatpak-sdk        SDK flatpak runtime for core-image-minimal

The runtime image is meant to be run on a target device while the SDK
image is meant to be used as a flatpak SDK runtime on your development
host to produce flatpaks for the device running the runtime image.
